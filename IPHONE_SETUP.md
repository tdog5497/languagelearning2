# 📱 iPhone Setup Guide

## Quick 3-Step Setup

### 1️⃣ Deploy to GitHub Pages
Follow the instructions in README.md to upload files and enable GitHub Pages.

Your app will be at: `https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/danish-deck/`

### 2️⃣ Open in Safari on iPhone
- Open **Safari** (must be Safari, not Chrome)
- Go to your GitHub Pages URL
- The app will load

### 3️⃣ Add to Home Screen
- Tap the **Share** button (square with up arrow) at the bottom
- Scroll down and tap **"Add to Home Screen"**
- Name it "Danish Deck" or anything you like
- Tap **"Add"**

## ✅ You're Done!

Now you have Danish Deck as an app on your iPhone home screen! It will:
- Open in full-screen mode (no browser UI)
- Work offline after first load
- Save all your data locally
- Feel like a native app

## 💾 About Your Data

**Your phrases and progress are saved on YOUR iPhone:**
- Data stays on your device (in Safari's localStorage)
- It persists even when you close the app
- It works offline
- It's private to you

**Data will be lost if you:**
- Clear Safari's website data
- Delete the app and clear data
- Switch to a different browser or device

**Pro Tip:** Stick to using Safari on your iPhone for consistent data access.

## 🔄 Using on Multiple Devices?

If you want to use Danish Deck on both your iPhone and computer:
- Each device stores its own data separately
- There's no automatic sync (this is an MVP feature)
- You'll need to add phrases on each device separately
- OR just pick one primary device for learning

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

**"Add to Home Screen" option not showing?**
- Make sure you're using Safari (not Chrome or Firefox)
- Try reloading the page first

**App not working after adding to home screen?**
- Make sure you have internet connection for first load
- Try clearing Safari cache and re-adding

**Lost all my data?**
- Check if you cleared Safari data recently
- Make sure you're opening from the home screen icon (same as original)
- Try logging in again with same credentials

## 🎉 Tips for Best Experience

1. **Bookmark it**: Even with home screen icon, bookmark in Safari as backup
2. **Regular practice**: Set a weekly goal (app suggests 3 sessions/week)
3. **Start small**: Add 5-10 phrases before trying AI chat
4. **Categories**: Use categories to organize phrases by context
5. **Review often**: Practice makes perfect!

Enjoy learning Danish! 🇩🇰
